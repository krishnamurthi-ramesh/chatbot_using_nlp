This chatbot uses the VADER sentiment analysis tool from NLTK(natural language tool kit), which assigns a sentiment polarity score to the input text.
 The get_sentiment_score function retrieves this score, and the interpret_sentiment function classifies á¶¿ sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on a threshold.
